# Meal app

The meals app, where we can dive into meals and categories, mark them as Favorites, and then also see them here under this favorites tab.
You can go to filters and set different filters, but which will affect what you see once we pick a category.  Ilearned a lot about navigation
in the multi-screen. A use providers with riverpod, set up a global state management provider,
which provides a dynamic value and may also provide methods
for changing that value.
Also learn how to set up explicit animations
by creating and initializing such a animation controller
AnimatedBuilder, and learn about Implicit animation with Hero widget.
